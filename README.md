## Hey! I'm Jesse!!

Iâ€™m a screenwriter/producer turned developer/designer after discovering my passion for game design while working at Nickelodeon. I love taking app and game ideas from concept to launch by shaping them, refining them, and adding polish to make them engaging, user-friendly, and genuinely useful.

Since beginning my coding journey, I've:
- Wrapped up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)
- Spent 4 years ideating games and producing them for Noggin ([some games can be found here](https://www.nick.com/games/all-games))
- QA'd for local game development studio, Moving Pieces Interactive on their game, [Entropy Survivors](https://www.movingpieces.io/entropy-survivors)
- Lauched a handleful of games, such as [MineFind](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minefind-puzzle-game/id6752503126), [Business Frog](https://sweetfreak.itch.io/business-frog), and more.
